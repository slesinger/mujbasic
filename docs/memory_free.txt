# Detailed list of addresses in the $0000-$0400 range that your application can use, with explanations:

1. Addresses Unused by System
Zero Page ($0000-$00FF)
$0002: Explicitly marked as "Unused".
$00FB-$00FE: "FREEZP" – Four free bytes of zero page for user programs. Guaranteed not to be altered by BASIC.
$0313 ($787): Explicitly marked as "Unused".
High RAM ($0334-$033B, $03FC-$03FF)
$0334-$033B: Eight free bytes for user vectors or other data.
$03FC-$03FF: Four more free bytes.
$02A7-$02FF: "Unused" – The programmer may use this area for machine language subroutines or graphics data storage.
2. Addresses Used by BASIC (which you are replacing)
Zero Page ($0000-$008F)
$0003-$008F: "BASIC Working Storage" – Used by BASIC only. If your application does not interact with BASIC, you can freely use this area.
BASIC Buffers and Tables
$0200-$0258: BASIC Line Editor Input Buffer ("BUF"). If you do not use BASIC, you can repurpose this buffer.
$0259-$0276: Tables for File Numbers, Device Numbers, and Secondary Addresses. Used by BASIC for I/O file management.
$0277-$0280: Keyboard Buffer (Queue). Used by BASIC for keyboard input.
$0300-$030B: BASIC Indirect Vector Table. Used for BASIC's internal routine vectors.
$030C-$0312: Register Storage Area for SYS command (BASIC only).
$0314-$0333: Interrupt vectors and Kernal indirect vectors. Caution: If you replace BASIC and also the Kernal, you may use these, but if you keep the Kernal, you must preserve these vectors.
3. Addresses Used by Cassette (which you do not use)
Zero Page
$00A6 ($166): Count of Characters in Tape I/O Buffer.
$0092 ($146): Timing Constant for Tape Reads.
$009B ($155): Tape Character Parity.
$009C ($156): Flag: Tape Byte Received.
$009E ($158): Tape Pass 1 Error Log Index.
$009F ($159): Tape Pass 2 Error Log Correction Index.
$00A5 ($165): Cassette Synchronization Character Countdown.
$00B0 ($176): Tape Timing.
$00B2-$00B3 ($178-$179): Pointer: Start of Tape Buffer.
$00BE ($190): Cassette Read/Write Block Count.
$00BF ($191): Tape Input Byte Buffer.
$00C0 ($192): Tape Motor Interlock.
$00C1-$00C2 ($193-$194): I/O Start Address (used for tape I/O).
$013F-$01FF ($319-$511): Tape Input Error Log (part of stack area, but used for tape error logging).
$033C-$03FB ($828-$1019): Cassette I/O Buffer (TBUFFER). If you do not use tape, this entire 192-byte buffer is available.
4. Other Candidates
Stack Area
$0100-$01FF: Microprocessor Stack Area. Do not use for persistent data, but you may use for temporary storage if you manage the stack pointer carefully.
BASIC Numeric Work Area
$0057-$0060: Used by BASIC for numeric calculations. If you replace BASIC, you may use this area.
BASIC Floating Point Accumulators
$0061-$006E: Used by BASIC for floating point math. If you replace BASIC, you may use this area.
BASIC CHRGET Routine
$0073-$008A: Used by BASIC for text parsing. If you replace BASIC, you may use this area.
BASIC RND Seed
$008B-$008F: Used by BASIC for random number generation. If you replace BASIC, you may use this area.

$0100-$01FF: Stack area. Do not use for persistent data.
$0146, $0155, $0156, $0158, $0159, $0165, $0166, $0176, $0178-$0179, $0190, $0191, $0192, $0193-$0194, $013F-$01FF, $033C-$03FB: All tape/cassette related. Free if you do not use tape.

Recommended for Your Application
$0002
$0003-$008F (if you replace BASIC)
$00FB-$00FE
$0200-$0258
$0259-$0276
$0277-$0280
$02A7-$02FF
$0313
$0334-$033B
$033C-$03FB (if you do not use cassette)
$03FC-$03FF
If you need more space
$0100-$01FF: Use for temporary storage only, not persistent data.
$0057-$008F: All BASIC work areas, including numeric, floating point, CHRGET, RND seed, etc., are available if you replace BASIC.
Summary
You have a large amount of RAM in $0002-$008F, $00FB-$00FE, $02A7-$02FF, $0334-$033B, $033C-$03FB, $03FC-$03FF, and all BASIC/cassette areas if you do not use those features.
Avoid $0000-$0001 unless you are handling memory banking and hardware I/O yourself.
Stack area ($0100-$01FF) is for temporary use only.
